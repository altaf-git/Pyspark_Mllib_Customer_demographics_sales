# Introduction to PySpark
PySpark is a great language for performing exploratory data analysis at scale, building machine learning pipelines, and creating ETLs for a data platform. If youâ€™re already familiar with Python and libraries such as Pandas, then PySpark is a great language to learn in order to create more scalable analyses and pipelines.
Apache Spark is an open-source cluster-computing framework, built around speed, ease of use, and streaming analytics whereas Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language. It provides a wide range of libraries and is majorly used for Machine Learning and Real-Time Streaming Analytics.
In other words, it is a Python API for Spark that lets you harness the simplicity of Python and the power of Apache Spark in order to tame Big Data. 
# PySpark Mllib
PySpark MLlib is a machine-learning library. It is a wrapper over PySpark Core to do data analysis using machine-learning algorithms. It works on distributed systems and is scalable. We can find implementations of classification, clustering, linear regression, and other machine-learning algorithms in PySpark MLlib.
